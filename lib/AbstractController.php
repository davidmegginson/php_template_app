 * Abstract base class for all HTTP controllers.

 * Controllers are classes that handle incoming HTTP requests and
 * prepare a response that can be rendered in a view.  Each of the
 * main HTTP request types (GET, POST, etc.)  has its own method,
 * which takes the $request parameters as input and uses the $response
 * object to produce output.
 *
 * Controllers are part of the well-established Model-View-Controller
 * architecture for web applications:
